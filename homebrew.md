# Homebrew
Please use the following commands in your command line interface to do so:
```bash
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
$ echo; echo 'eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/w60292/.zshrc
$ eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"
``` 

Is it working?
```bash
$ brew --version
Homebrew 4.1.15
```
